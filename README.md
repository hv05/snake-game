# 🎮 Simon Says Game

A classic memory-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players must remember and repeat an increasing sequence of colors generated by the system. Each correct round increases the difficulty, while an incorrect sequence ends the game.

This project improved my understanding of JavaScript logic, event handling, arrays, timing functions, and DOM manipulation.
